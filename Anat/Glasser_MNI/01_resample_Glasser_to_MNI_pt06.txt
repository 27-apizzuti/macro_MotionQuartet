Glasser atlas is in MNI space at 1 iso mm; we are working with MNI data at 0.6 iso mm. 
 
1) Find TRX from MNI 1 iso -> MNI 0.6 
	In ITK-SNAP, load MNI volume at 0.6 iso mm as main and MNI at 1 iso mm as secondary. Use 'registration' using centre of mass alignment. 	Find the TRX and save it.
2) Apply TRX. In ITK-SNAP, load MNI volume at 0.6 iso mm as main and Glasser MNI 1 iso mm as secondary. Load TRX and apply it. Reslice using NN.
